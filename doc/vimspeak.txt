INTRODUCTION                                *vimspeak*

vimspeak is a plugin for connecting vim to espeak. It overrides the default
behavior of the s and S keybindings. The former, when combined with a motion,
will read the implicated text aloud - for example, s} will read the next
paragraph, sw will read the next word, and ss will read the current line.

The S key is a prefix which can be combined with other keys to do more specific
actions:

- St: toggle vimspeak off or on (default: on or g:vimspeak_enabled=1)
- Sc: cancel the current reading
- Sl: read out the current line number
- Ss: adjust the speed of speech (default: 250 or g:vimspeak_speed="-s 250")
- Sp: toggle punctuation (default: on or g:vimspeak_punct="--punct")
- Sb: read the name of the current buffer

There are also some autocmds set up, which will read the name of the current
buffer whenever it changes, let you know when the file was written, and read out
the working directory when it changes.

SETTINGS                                    *settings*

vimspeak reads a few global variables to adjust its behavior:

g:vimspeak_args: arguments passed to espeak (default: -k30)

g:vimspeak_speed: arguments passed to espeak (default: -s 250)

g:vimspeak_punct: arguments passed to espeak (default: --punct)

g:vimspeak_enabled: set to 1 to enable vimspeak, or 0 otherwise (default 1)
